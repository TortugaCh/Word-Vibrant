      "As a mother of a first-grader and former Chinese teacher at an international school, I noticed a gap in existing educational tools. This inspired me to create this learning platform. While it's still evolving, it's built with love and open to community input for continuous improvement.",

      "Repetition and visual learning are key to early childhood education. Our tools utilize visual character recognition methods through stroke animation and interactive attempts. Characters appear throughout stories and dialogues, helping children remember character forms while understanding their usage in context.",

    ourVisionDescription: `In the era of AI advancement, we aim to make "Language in Motion" a starting point for smoother character recognition and AI-enhanced learning experiences, exploring endless possibilities in education technology.
